**Scoping Note for Portfolio Optimization Project**

**1. Planning of the Project:**

The project will be rougly divided into two main phases:

**3. Project Explanation and Objectives:**

The project aims to implement an AI-guided algorithm for optimizing portfolios within a 10-minute timeframe, considering specified risk tolerance levels. This addresses the need for efficient portfolio management in dynamic market conditions. By utilizing a combination of classic methods and AI techniques, the project seeks to construct portfolios with the highest return while respecting risk constraints. 

Key objectives include developing a robust optimization strategy, validating its performance over multiple timestamps, measuring stability over time, and forecasting optimal portfolios for various risk appetites. 

The project will utilize a dataset from a Kaggle competition, with challenges including data organization and thorough utilization for both strategy building and validation. The project's outcomes have practical applications in automated trading systems and dynamic asset allocation for investors.
