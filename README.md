**Scoping Note for Portfolio Optimization Project**

**1. Planning of the Project:**

The project will be rougly divided into two main phases:

**Phase 1: Defining Portfolio Optimization Strategy & Data Prediction Methods**
- Duration: Month 1-2
- Tasks: 
  - Conduct literature review on portfolio optimization methods including classic methods like Markowitz and Black-Litterman, as well neural networks litterature review.
  - Conduct literature review on ways to predict the information at time $t + \delta$ given information at time $t$.
  - Explore dataset structure and relevant features for optimization.
  - Design and implement portfolio optimization framework, considering returns, realized volatilities and correlations of the stocks.
  - Design and implement data prediction framework.

**Phase 2: Development of Real-Time Algorithm**
- Duration: Month 2-3
- Tasks:
  - Implement real-time algorithm to generate optimal portfolio within 10 minutes given current market conditions and specified risk tolerance.
  - Integrate neural networks for dynamic portfolio allocation.
  - Test algorithm performance on real data.
  - Evaluate stability over time and forecast optimal portfolios for varying risk appetites.
  - Validate efficiency and robustness of optimization strategy data prediction methods on historical data.

**Key Dates:**
- Project Kick-off: Month 1, Week 1
- Phase 1 Completion: Month 1, Week 4
- Mid-Project Review: Month 2, Week 2
- Phase 2 Completion: Month 3, Week 4
- Final Presentation: Month 3, Week 4

Students must familiarize themselves with the work carried out by their classmates during regular meetings in order to be able to make their own contribution later, in particular regarding what concerns Literature Review.

**3. Project Explanation and Objectives:**

The project aims to implement an AI-guided algorithm for optimizing portfolios within a 10-minute timeframe, considering specified risk tolerance levels. This addresses the need for efficient portfolio management in dynamic market conditions. By utilizing a combination of classic methods and AI techniques, the project seeks to construct portfolios with the highest return while respecting risk constraints. 

Key objectives include developing a robust optimization strategy, validating its performance over multiple timestamps, measuring stability over time, and forecasting optimal portfolios for various risk appetites. 

The project will utilize a dataset from a Kaggle competition, with challenges including data organization and thorough utilization for both strategy building and validation. The project's outcomes have practical applications in automated trading systems and dynamic asset allocation for investors.
